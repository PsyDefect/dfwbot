Some simple proof of concept IRC bots built on Bot::BasicBot

One is a greeter bot (it just says hi)

One is a spell checker bot (it checks your psellling)

One is a dictionary bot (it looks up word definitions) if you use this, get your own API key

One is a bare-bones bot that takes plugins in the form of Moose roles (examples provided)
